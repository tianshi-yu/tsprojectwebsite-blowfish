## Wearable Soft Sensor System for Hand Gesture Recognition

**This integrated sensor system comprises a 3D-printable soft sensor body and an embedded signal-processing and data-transmission module. It is highly wearable and achieves 97.7% accuracy for 13 hand gestures, making it suitable for virtual-reality interaction and prosthesis control.**

- Programmed the **ESP32** microcontrollers: implemented sensor-data acquisition and transmission firmware using **SPI**, **ADC**, **BLE**, and **Wi‑Fi**, and developed a virtual-reality interaction environment in **Unity (C#)**.

- Manufactured the sensor body by 3D printing using soft thermoplastic polyurethane (TPU) material.

- Collaborated with colleagues at [Human Robotics Lab](https://blogs.unimelb.edu.au/human-robotics/). Results were published in the IEEE Journal of Biomedical and Health Informatics (IEEE JBHI).
